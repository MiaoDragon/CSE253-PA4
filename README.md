* dataloader  --  Yinglong
** obtain_map: obtain the character-to-one-hot, and logists-to-character mappings.
** create_split_loaders: obtain train, val, test dataloaders, and mappings as above.

* Network architecture (LSTM, vanilla RNN)  -- Yinglong
** when initializing, pass type='LSTM' or 'vanilla' for different types of RNN models.
** forward: take in input and an optional parameter state_0, outputs sequence outputs and last hidden state state_n
** predict: output only the logists output, given input and optinal state_0

* train

* test

* generate
